Openship is an order router that connects the places where you're selling to the places where you're fulfilling. It automatically routes orders from your sales channels to your fulfillment partners, giving you complete control over your order flow.

Built on top of [next-keystone-starter](https://github.com/junaid33/next-keystone-starter), which provides the foundational architecture for modern full-stack applications with KeystoneJS and Next.js.

## Core Concepts

### Shops
Shops represent your online stores where your customers place orders (e.g. Shopify, WooCommerce, eBay, Amazon). Once connected, new orders can be routed to Openship to be fulfilled.

### Channels
Channels represent destinations where your orders can be routed and fulfilled. A channel could be an existing platform like your supplier's Shopify shop or a 3PL fulfillment service. It could also be something very simple like adding a row to a Google Sheet or sending an email with the order details.

### Links
Links represent a connection between a shop and a channel. Once linked, new shop orders are forwarded to the linked channel for fulfillment.

### Matches
For finer control over the fulfillment process, matches can be created on the product level. Matches represent a connection between your shop products and your channel products. When a match is created between a shop product and channel product, Openship will automatically process that order.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Backend**: KeystoneJS 6 with GraphQL API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Authentication**: Session-based with role-based permissions
- **Foundation**: Built on [next-keystone-starter](https://github.com/junaid33/next-keystone-starter)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ 
- PostgreSQL database
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

### Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openship-org/openship.git
   cd openship
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   
   Update `.env` with your configuration:
   ```env
   # Required - Database Connection
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/openship"
   
   # Required - Session Security (must be at least 32 characters)
   SESSION_SECRET="your-very-long-session-secret-key-here-32-chars-minimum"
   
   # Optional - SMTP configuration for email notifications
   SMTP_FROM="no-reply@yourdomain.com"
   SMTP_HOST="your-smtp-host"
   SMTP_PASSWORD="your-smtp-password"
   SMTP_PORT="587"
   SMTP_USER="your-smtp-user"
   
   # Optional - Shop Integrations
   SHOPIFY_APP_KEY="your-shopify-app-key"
   SHOPIFY_APP_SECRET="your-shopify-app-secret"
   
   # Optional - Channel Integrations
   SHIPPO_API_KEY="shippo_test_..."
   ```

3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will:
   - Build KeystoneJS schema
   - Run database migrations
   - Start Next.js development server with Turbopack

4. **Access the application:**
   - **Dashboard**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - Order routing interface
   - **GraphQL API**: [http://localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql) - Interactive API explorer

5. **Create your first admin user:**
   On first visit to the dashboard, you'll be prompted to create an admin user account at `/init`

6. **Connect your first shop and channel:**
   After creating your admin account, start by connecting a shop (where orders come from) and a channel (where orders are fulfilled)

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Build Keystone + migrate + start Next.js dev server
- `npm run build` - Build Keystone + migrate + build Next.js for production
- `npm run migrate:gen` - Generate and apply new database migrations
- `npm run migrate` - Deploy existing migrations to database
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
